## Today's translation problems
There is a lot of problem involved with translating an application today. Regardless of which languague it is written in. The main problems are maintenance, inefficent workflow and inability to translate complex translations.

Examples:

* A key got deleted from source. You have to yourself delete the key in all your localization files.
* If a translation key got added to source. You have to youself add the key to all you localization files.
* Translators often need to contact developers for translation.
* Trouble to translate gender context. E.g. `You gave him 5 coins`
* Trouble to translate multiple translation forms. Some languages don't just have singular and plural they have more than 2 plural forms.
* Translators need to learn complex language syntax to solve complex translations. E.g. ICU.
